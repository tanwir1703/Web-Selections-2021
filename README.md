# Web-Selections-2021
Greetings from Students' Alumni Cell!

For the next round of the selection process, you are required to complete (atleast) 3 of the following tasks:

1. Clone the following web-page [Profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist) (Destop Version, First Page).                                          
   Requirements : HTML , CSS, Frameworks(such as Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.)
2. General Programming skills I:  Given an integer n, print all the Armstrong numbers between the range [1,n] (inclusive). An Armstrong number is a positive n-digit number that is    equal to the sum of the nth powers of their digits. Example :  1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 153      
   Available languages: C, C++ (without STL), python, JAVA, JavaScript.

3. General Programming skills II: Given an integer n and an integer array A containing n integers, print the maximum subarray sum.     
   A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. An array that is inside another array. For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4] ,{ [1, 2, 3, 4], [] ,[2, 3] } are considered      subarrays and {[1,3] , [2,1]} are not considered subarray.                                           
   Output: An Integer corresponding to the maximum subarray sum.                                                             
   Available languages: C, C++ (without STL), python, JAVA.

4. Document Object Model: Create a Webpage with a form, taking any two fields (say a movie and it's IMDB rating), and a Table below it, with these two as fields. On clicking the      submit button, your Javascript program should edit the inner HTML of the next row elements, to be those submitted values.
5. Create a sign up form using NodeJS and MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB. After a successful sign up, add an alert for the successful execution as "Congratulations /Name/, You are          registered!". Be sure to use Restful APIs only.
